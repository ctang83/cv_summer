   Abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Law for Licensing Medical Practitioners of the People?s Republic of China, enacted in 1999, was amended in 2021. This commentary reviews the key points of the amendment and raises doubts as to one of its points. Specifically, we argue that the minimum education level required to take the physicians? licensing examination should be set to completion of a bachelor degree, instead of a vocational diploma or junior college graduation as in the 2021 amendment. China adopted a system of multi-tiered medical education more than 70 years ago. This policy has resulted in a threshold of entry-level medical education far below the global standards. The highly heterogeneous education background of physicians in China has led to low standards of practicing physicians, which in turn have significantly negative impacts on the health care market. We illustrate changes over time in the educational distribution and regional distribution of practicing physicians in China, and present reasons to improve entry-level educational standards, by setting the physician licensing threshold at an appropriate level. This will not only improve the overall quality of physicians but will also help address equity and efficiency issues in the health care market.},

   Abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and is projected to be the third by 2030. However, there is little evidence available on the associations of COPD hospitalizations with meteorological factors and air pollutants in developing countries/regions of Asia. In particular, no study has been done in western areas of China considering the nonlinear and lagged effects simultaneously. This study aims to evaluate the nonlinear and lagged associations of COPD hospitalizations with meteorological factors and air pollutants using time-series analysis. The modified associations by sex and age were also investigated. The distributed lag nonlinear model was used to establish the association of daily COPD hospitalizations of all 441 public hospitals in Chengdu, China from Jan/2015–Dec/2017 with the ambient meteorological factors and air pollutants. Model parameters were optimized based on quasi Akaike Information Criterion and model diagnostics was conducted by inspecting the deviance residuals. Subgroup analysis by sex and age was also performed. Temperature, relative humidity, wind and Carbon Monoxide (CO) have statistically significant and consistent associations with COPD hospitalizations. The cumulative relative risk (RR) was lowest at a temperature of 19℃ (relative humidity of 67%). Both extremely high and low temperature (and relative humidity) increase the cumulative RR. An increase of wind speed above 4 mph (an increase of CO above 1.44 mg/m3) significantly decreases (increases) the cumulative RR. Female populations were more sensitive to low temperature and high CO level; elderly (74+) populations are more sensitive to high relative humidity; younger populations (< = 74) are more susceptible to CO higher than 1.44 mg/m3. Therefore, people with COPD should avoid exposure to adverse environmental conditions of extreme temperatures and relative humidity, low wind speed and high CO level, especially for female and elderly patients who were more sensitive to extreme temperatures and relative humidity.},

   Abstract = {Introduction Primary healthcare (PHC) serves as the cornerstone for the attainment of universal health coverage (UHC). Efforts to promote UHC should focus on the expansion of access and on healthcare quality. However, robust quality evidence has remained scarce in China. Common quality assessment methods such as chart abstraction, patient rating and clinical vignette use indirect information that may not represent real practice. This study will send standardised patients (SP or healthy person trained to consistently simulate the medical history, physical symptoms and emotional characteristics of a real patient) unannounced to PHC providers to collect quality information and represent real practice.Methods and analysis 1981 SP–clinician visits will be made to a random sample of PHC providers across seven provinces in China. SP cases will be developed for 10 tracer conditions in PHC. Each case will include a standard script for the SP to use and a quality checklist that the SP will complete after the clinical visit to indicate diagnostic and treatment activities performed by the clinician. Patient-centredness will be assessed according to the Patient Perception of Patient-Centeredness Rating Scale by the SP. SP cases and the checklist will be developed through a standard protocol and assessed for content, face and criterion validity, and test–retest and inter-rater reliability before its full use. Various descriptive analyses will be performed for the survey results, such as a tabulation of quality scores across geographies and provider types.Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the School of Public Health of Sun Yat-sen University (#SYSU 2017-011). Results will be actively disseminated through print and social media, and SP tools will be made available for other researchers.},

   Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify whether the interorganization of healthcare providers in China had the global property of an oligopoly market tendencies by analyzing the rich-club phenomenon of patient flow. This paper examines the properties of patient transfer networks in an entire province of China using social network analysis. Hypertension is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in China, thus the study examined the transfer network of patients with hypertension. The rich-club coefficient, the assortativity coefficient, and community detection were used to quantitatively illustrate the rich-club tendency of the social network. The results reveal significant rich-club characteristics and regional clustering patterns in this transfer network. First, the global rich-club coefficients calculated based on both degree and weighted degree are larger than 1, suggesting a relatively noticeable rich-club effect. Second, 269 nodes (69.33%) attach only to rich nodes, suggesting that most nodes within the hypertensive-patient transfer network are highly influenced by rich-club members. Third, community detection found a significant pattern of regional clustering in the transfer network. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that the hospital system operated as an oligopoly market, in which the “elite” providers formed an “inner circle”, and other providers were only loosely interconnected. It might be valuable to patients to transfer this oligarchical system into a more pluralistic network.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To achieve universal health coverage in China, it is necessary to identify access barriers to health care. This study examined the association between health system characteristics and health care utilization in China and identified factors associated with accessing health care among the mid-aged and elderly. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, and 17 370 respondents aged 45 and above were included in the analysis. The dependent variables were the use of outpatient and inpatient care among respondents. Health system characteristics at the provincial level were measured using the density of doctors and ward beds, health expenditure per visit/admission and health financing. A two-level logistic regression model was constructed to examine association between health care utilization and health system characteristics, controlling for predisposing, enabling and need variables. RESULTS: Of the 17 370 respondents, 18.3% had utilized outpatient care and 13.7% had utilized inpatient care in 2015. Increases in the share of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments as total health spending at the provincial-level was less likely to be associated with outpatient care utilization (odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-0.98) among the mid-age and elderly population. Increases in the share of OOP payments (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00) and health expenditure per admission (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.04-0.88) were less likely to be associated with inpatient care utilization, while increases in the density of beds (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.43) was more likely to be associated with inpatient care utilization. gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at the provincial level and types of health insurance owned by respondents were significantly related to both inpatient and outpatient care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Low affordability of the mid-aged and elderly population is the main barrier to utilizing health care in China. In order to improve access to health care, the government should make more efforts, such as improving health insurance reimbursement rates and implementing prospective provider payment methods, to decrease OOP payment for the ageing population.},

In addition, the community detection was also carried out to find the relationship between rich members and non-rich members. The findings indicate an oligopoly in which Class-III hospitals occupy an overwhelmingly dominant position over the competition. Also, the characteristic ‘significant regional clustering’ was inferred from the results.},

   Abstract = {Entrepreneurial followers are defined as the crucial members of a specific entrepreneurial team and do not include the leader or normal employees in the present paper. This population can be viewed as indispensable factors in the success of entrepreneurship, especially in the start-up stage. In addition, according to the following time, they can be divided into two groups, namely long-term entrepreneurial followers and short-term entrepreneurial followers. However, studies focusing on entrepreneurship cultivation for entrepreneurial followers are relatively few. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the needs of Chinese entrepreneurial followers in entrepreneurship cultivation from the early stage of entrepreneurship. In this paper, a sample of 200 long-term entrepreneurial followers from Tinafu New Area in China was investigated. To enable the researchers to explore the unique opinions of entrepreneurial followers, a mixed data collection approach that combined interviews and questionnaires was chosen in this study. The results revealed following findings: (a) high levels of social capital, good entrepreneurial opportunities and projects, and highly cooperative teams were viewed as the most important factors for entrepreneurship by entrepreneurial followers in China; (b) most entrepreneurial followers believed that the primary difficulty in the cultivation process was the inefficiency in talent training mechanism; (c) nearly 40% of samples suggested that the cultivation and enhancement of local talents should be firstly carried out by the Chinese government, indicating a gap between the supporting force for local and returned talents in China. In addition, various types of incentive policies and good environments for talent growth were also considered as important suggestions by entrepreneurial followers. We found that unlike entrepreneurial leaders, entrepreneurial followers focus more on income expectation, and personal development rather than supporting the development of companies in China. These findings should be viewed as priorities when enhancing current entrepreneurship cultivation in China.},

In this paper, we use a laboratory experiment to test the performance of a potential remedy discussed in the applied literature, the separation of prescription and treatment activities. We observe a significant amount of overtreatment (and a smaller nonpredicted amount of undertreatment) in our baseline environment. Requiring a different than the treating physician to provide diagnosis and prescription for free is an effective way to reduce overtreatment in our laboratory setting. This effect, however, is partially offset by an increased frequency of undertreatment. Allowing prescription and treatment physicians to independently set prices for their services reduces efficiency due to coordination failures: In sum, prices are often higher than expected benefit of patients, who in turn do not attend to the physician. Also contrary to theory, bargaining power does not play a significant role for the distribution of profits between physicians.},

Low job satisfaction was associated with specialty, training opportunity, and income inequality. Conclusions: The minority of health-care staff belong to the “satisfied class”. Three among four subgroups are not satisfied with income, benefit, training, and career development.

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Primary Care Providers (PCPs), such as internists and general practitioners, have been deemed a way of delivering cost-effective care in an equitable way because PCPs are responsible for providing accessible basic medical care for the general population. This study aims to examine medical students' preferences for PCP-based specialty choices in the context of an ageing population in China.METHODS:We implemented a Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) experiment, a recently developed preference elicitation method based on random utility theory. Three hundred and fifty graduating medical students from three medical colleges were randomly recruited to evaluate 11 common medical specialties in China. A counting approach, a conditional logit model, and K-means clustering have been used to analyse the relative importance of items and preference heterogeneity among medical students.RESULTS:One hundred and ninety of 350 students completed valid questionnaires. General surgery was identified as the most preferred specialty among the overall sample, yet internal medicine shares the same importance as surgery. Both geriatric medicine and psychiatric medicine were found to be the least selected specialties. Finally, the K-means clustering further suggested there was preference heterogeneity across our sample.CONCLUSIONS:Two aims were fulfilled in this study. First, through our experimental approach the results provide a better understanding of the career desires of medical students in China. Second, the results of this study indicate that despite the fact a non-PCP-based specialty is the most popular among the sampled students; a PCP-based specialty is still an important alternative choice.},

   Abstract = {China's top legislature amended a law that ?sets environmental protection as the country's basic policy?, which planned to force regulators to make improvements in air quality. Limited studies have attempted to estimate separate values for attributes of air quality improvements from the perspective of how residents value the reduction of haze and health benefits. We apply a discrete choice experiment to estimate the economic benefits involved in these changes. The analysis demonstrates that residents from urban areas are positively willing to pay for air quality improvement. We further employ a mixed logit model and a latent class model to investigate potential heterogeneity in preferences. The preference heterogeneity is significantly related to individuals' exposure to health risks relating to air quality, which is represented by whether the residence location of the respondent is covered by haze/smog on the interview day.

   Abstract = {Background: China significantly opened its healthcare market through a series of market-opening policies in 2000–1. This study aims to explore the direct consequences of these policies—the growth of private hospitals, their workforce characteristics compared with public hospitals in China and the source of their healthcare workforce.Methods: First, we performed a segmented regression analysis of a longitudinal data series of the number of hospitals in China between 1990 and 2009 to examine the before and after effects of the market-opening policy on private hospitals. Then, to highlight the workforce differences between private and public hospitals, provincial survey data collected in 2009 were compared with data from a second database collected in 2002 to detect the mobility of medical staff from the public to the private hospitals.Results: The number of private hospitals rapidly increased after 2001, and the yearly growth rate increased from 19 to 205, represented primarily by an increase in specialty hospitals. Approximately 22.03% of the physicians in private hospitals are over the age of 60, whereas this proportion in public hospitals is only 2.97%. In 2008, at least 4.1% of the staff working in private hospitals had previously worked in local public hospitals in 2001.Conclusion: The broad expansion of private hospitals since 2001 is most likely the result of an unbiased market policy environment for private hospitals. Moreover, specific features of the hospital–physician relationship in China may account for the unbalanced age distribution feature among doctors and the mobility of the healthcare workforce in private hospitals.

   Abstract = {China has recently placed increased emphasis on the provision of primary healthcare services through health sector reform, in response to inequitably distributed health services. With increasing funding for community level facilities, now is an opportune time to assess the quality of primary care delivery and identify areas in need of further improvement. A mixed methodology approach was adopted for this study. Quantitative data were collected using the Primary Care Assessment Tool-Chinese version (C-PCAT), a questionnaire previously adapted for use in China to assess the quality of care at each health facility, based on clients' experiences. In addition, qualitative data were gathered through eight semi-structured interviews exploring perceptions of primary care with health directors and a policy maker to place this issue in the context of health sector reform. The study found that patients attending community health and sub-community health centres are more likely to report better experiences with primary care attributes than patients attending hospital facilities. Generally low scores for community orientation, family centredness and coordination in all types of health facility indicate an urgent need for improvement in these areas. Healthcare directors and policy makers perceived the need for greater coordination between levels of health providers, better financial reimbursement, more formal government contracts and recognition/higher status for staff at the community level and more appropriate undergraduate and postgraduate training.
